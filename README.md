# AutoCite
Automatic MLA Citation Generator that I hacked together in a few hours for a school project. 

# Tutorial
1. Download and extract the files. Keep them all in **the same** folder. 
2. Run the "autocite.py" file. If you do not know how to run a python file click [here](https://docs.python.org/3/faq/windows.html#how-do-i-run-a-python-program-under-windows)
3. Follow the prompts. Hit enter **twice** to enter a value.
4. Your citations will be generated to a text file in `./citations/MLA/` which includes the proper citation, the parenthetical In-Line-Citation, and the effective title (this is for organizational purposes. If you did everything correctly you can safely ignore this thing.)
